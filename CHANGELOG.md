# Changelog

All notable changes follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## [Unreleased] — v0.4.0 (product redefinition)

### Changed (BREAKING — product scope)
- **muten is redefined from "PC forced-mute" to "endpoint environment
  enforcement (audio + screen)".** The audio enforcement is unchanged
  and fully backward compatible; the product now *also* detects scam /
  full-screen overlay windows on the same managed PCs. README and
  positioning updated accordingly. See `Plan.md` for the scope
  decision and `docs/OVERLAY_BLOCKING.md` for the design.

### Added
- **`muten-overlay` crate** — pure-domain scam-overlay classifier
  (`forbid(unsafe_code)`, no OS, no network):
  - `OverlayWindow` observation type (title, url, coverage, topmost,
    close button, input capture, origin, age).
  - `classify()` — explainable additive-score heuristic with named
    weights; returns `Verdict { decision, score, signals, matched_rule }`.
  - `Decision`: `Allow` / `Suspicious` (audit, don't dismiss) / `Block`.
  - Offline `Ruleset` blocklist (host + subdomain matching, title
    substring patterns, comments, bare-host lines). Pushed via MDM,
    read offline.
  - `muten-overlay` dry-run CLI: `classify` (exit 0/5/6) and `rules`.
  - 18 unit tests + 7 property tests (~1,800 random cases): classifier
    never panics, score monotone in each suspicious signal, decision
    thresholds consistent, blocklist parser never panics, subdomain
    matching, hard-block on host hit.
- Example blocklist (`examples/overlay-blocklist.txt`) and sample scam
  observation (`examples/overlay-sample.json`).
- `docs/OVERLAY_BLOCKING.md`.

### Design notes
- **Observe-first**: default posture flags suspicious overlays for IT
  review rather than auto-dismissing, because false positives would
  break legitimate full-screen apps (video, presentations, exams,
  kiosk UIs). Only confirmed blocklist hits or unmistakable scores
  (≥100) yield `Block`.
- **No ML**: transparent, auditable scoring per CLAUDE.md I6 / Pike.
- **Privacy (I5)**: classification is fully on-device; no window
  metadata leaves the machine.

### Pending (next session)
- OS-specific window enumerator + dismisser (like the audio backends).
- Merge `muten-overlay` into the restored workspace + wire daemon to
  emit `OverlayBlocked` / `OverlaySuspicious` audit events into the
  hash chain.
- New `EventKind::OverlayBlocked` / `OverlaySuspicious` + SIEM severity
  mapping.
- README full rewrite around the "audio + screen" positioning.

## [0.3.x] / [0.3.0] / [0.2.0] / [0.1.x]

(Prior audio-enforcement history — preserved in earlier transcripts
and the restored workspace.)
